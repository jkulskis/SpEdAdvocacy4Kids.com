                I highly recommend working with Margie. You will get first class
                help with obtaining services, support, and resources for your
                child. I know her as my Special Education Advocate, aka "my IEP
                angel." She helped me sort through the myriad of options to get
                support for my ASD/Autistic son at his public school. And then
                when that support wasn't enough, she advocated for him to get an
                out-of-district placement. It was certainly a major struggle,
                both emotionally and physically, for my husband and me, and if
                it weren't for Margie's expertise, I think we would still be
                banging our heads against the wall (or you could say, pulling
                our hair out!) If I were in your shoes (and I was!,) I would
                trust Margie 100% for Special Education Advocacy.

                I am happy to highly recommend Margie Mikulskis without
                reservation. Margie has been phenomenal in working with a little
                boy who is a medically complex client of mine. Margie agreed
                without reservation to take on this difficult case and become
                his special education advocate. I was immediately impressed by
                Margie’s extensive knowledge of special education, dedication
                and enthusiasm to help this little boy get more services. She
                immediately came up with a game plan to advocate. Her tenacity
                and persistence to collaborate with his multiple providers,
                parents and care coordinators demonstrated that Margie is a team
                player who values others’ input into the situation. She was
                resourceful, very caring and open minded to what the parent’s
                vision was for their son. She has special gifts with
                communication, organization, planning, research and
                collaboration. Margie was also very resourceful in getting the
                family a wheelchair ramp. She has made a real positive impact on
                this little boy’s quality of life. I was impressed with her
                enthusiasm, kindness, extensive knowledge of special education
                and her resourcefulness.

                I cannot say enough good things about Margie and her dedication
                to the students she works with and their families! I recently
                worked with her on a difficult case that would not have yielded
                such a positive result if not for her hard work. It was lovely
                to partner with such a professional, compassionate, and
                knowledgable individual. I will definitely refer her to
                applicants that are not eligible for our services in that I know
                they will be in great hands.

                We highly recommend working with Margie. My daughter was
